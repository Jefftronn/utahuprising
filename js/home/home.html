  <p>It all started with a couple of people who decided to start a competative team. Magic and Roby first started to look for talent in paintball fields throughout the Salt Lake Valley. <br> </br> They hand picked a few players to join, while most of these players have never played together. We then grew together and became family with one goal in mind, to win! </p>
