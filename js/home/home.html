  <p>It all started with a couple of people who decided to start a competative team. Magic and Roby first started to look for talent in paintball fields throughout the Salt Lake Valley.  They hand picked a few players to join while, most of these players have never played together. We then grew together and became family with one goal in mind, to win! </p>
